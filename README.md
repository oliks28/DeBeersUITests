From the homepage 

- On the menu bar, select ABOUT US  and Technology 
  - Verify "World-leading Technology" text exists. 
- Using the search magnifying glass icon on the menu bar, search "DiamondProof" 
  - Return the number of results 
  - And the pages titles 
- Search for "Jwaneng"
  - The webpage will display a list of predicted searches. Get the list of suggestions from the  predicted searches pop-up. 
		
Please fork this repository and raise a pull request push to merge your code to GitHub.
